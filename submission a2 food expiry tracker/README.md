# Food Expiry Tracker

A beginner friendly Python project for working with data and code at university that is designed to help busy households keep track of their food organisatio and reduce waste.  
The Food Expiry Tracker lets users add, view, and manage food items by expiry date, as well as with a simple colour-coded system that shows what’s still fresh and what’s about to expire.

# Why I Made This Project
I created this project to combine creativity and problem-solving while learning to code in Visual Stuio Code.  
Food waste is a common issue in many homes, and I wanted to design something small but meaningful that could make everyday life a little easier.

 # Built With
- Language: Python  
- Tools: Tkinter (for the GUI)

No extra libraries are needed as everything runs with standard VS code and Python.

Future Improvements

# This project could grow into a more advanced household assistant with features like:
Notifications or reminders before food expires.
Recipe suggestions to use ingredients nearing expiry.
Mobile app integration for on-the-go tracking.
Optional login system or cloud data storage.
